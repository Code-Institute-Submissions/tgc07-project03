|-------|----------|---------------|
| admin@email.com | password123 | administrator |
| limited@email.com | password123 | limited |

This website has been designed for PC hardware enthusiasts to post their reviews on PC components. The general public are able read the reviews for free, without any requirement to login. However, to post a review, comment, or vote, registation for a user account and login are required.

The site owner is assumed to be part of the Amazon affiliate programme, enabling the website to earn affiliate referral income from any click-throughs to product purchases. 

### Disclaimer
Most, if not all, of the external links in this project direct towards actual Amazon products, however **the affiliate referral modifiers are not genuine**.

## UX

### Strategy - User Stories
Members of the public would use the website to:

- Read comments made on reviews to understand other people's views and opinions.
- Post reviews to be help the PC enthusiast community.
- Post comments to share personal experiences and opinions on PC products.
- Help the PC entusiast community members with any troubleshooting problems they may have encountered.

- Be able to moderate the site content via admin accounts that can edit and delete reviews and comments, to maintain a friendly and welcoming environment for all users.
- Also be users of the site, by posting and reading reviews/comments related to PC components.

### Scope
Content requirements:
- images of PC components being reviewed
- text for review content
- URLs to Amazon product pages
- icons for vote feature

Functional specification:
- vote buttons need to be able to function without requiring page to reload
- pages to separate reviews into manageable sizes so that each web page does not get too long

### Structure
The website structure will be presented using the hierarchical model. Main sections will be:
- review threads
- categories
- users

- HTML
- CSS

- [Flask-Login 0.5.0](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for user authentication
- [passlib 1.7.2](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for password hashing
- [Jinja 2.11.2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) for templating
- [pymongo 3.11.0](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/) to communicate with MongoDB database using Python
- [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) to use environment variables
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) for DOM manipulation
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for AJAX calls

## Programming Methodologies
- RESTful API was used to allow casting of votes, counting votes, counting comments and retrieving sub-categories via AJAX calls.
- .env file was used to store environment variables so that Flask secret key and database credentials were not publicly viewable.
